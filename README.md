## Market Overview
<h5> 
Governments and cities have introduced regulations to support the mobility shift. According to a report The European Union presented its "Fit for 55" program, which seeks to align energy, transport and various other policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at lelast 55% by 2030, and the Biden administration introduced a 50% electric vehicle target for 2030. Beyond this alot of governments are also offering EV subsidies.
Cities are trying to reduce use of private vehicles and congestion by providing greater support alternative mobility modes such as electic vehicles.
India is one of the world's largest markets for both two and three- wheeler vehicles, ranking among the global top 5 for cars and commercial vehicles. According to <a href="https://jmkresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ARC-EV-FY22.pdf">JMK research</a>
, 455,733 EV units were sold in FY2022. </h5>
